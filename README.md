## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> Expect the **first** seed search to take a very long time (>1 min) in order to compile the backend.
> Subsequent searches will be _much_ faster.

1. Go to `Mods -> Crystal Ball -> Edit seed filter`
2. Add a new filter with `Add row`
3. Configure the filter:
    - **Min/max ante:** Select the min/max ante the jokers will appear (inclusive)
    - **Num matches:** Select the _minimum_ number of jokers to find (or `All` to find all jokers)
4. Start a new game as normal

## Where Can Jokers Be Found?

**Non-legendary Jokers:**
- Found in shop & buffoon packs
- Number of re-rolls scales per ante:
  - Ante 1 ⇒ 0 re-rolls, Ante 2 ⇒ 1 re-roll, etc.

**Legendary Jokers:**
- Found in arcana & spectral shop packs

This mod does **not** search for jokers from another other source, including skip tag packs / free jokers.

## Future Plans

- Search for vouchers / spectral cards / playing cards
- Customisation options (custom re-rolls per ante, search timeouts, etc.)
- Support for Showman / duplicate jokers
- Prevent jokers from appearing in the same pack
- Prevent the selection of locked jokers
- Option to fix the order in which jokers appear
- Option to create/select multiple filter sets

## Thanks

Thank you to the team behind [Immolate](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Immolate) for making this mod possible!
