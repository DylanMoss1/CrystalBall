## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> The first time the mod is ran, it will take a long time to find a seed. If the search timeout is exceeded YOU MUST EXIT AND REOPEN BALATRO.
> After the first search, subsequent runs will be _much_ faster.

**Non-legendary Jokers:** 
- Found in shop & buffoon packs.
- Number of re-rolls scales per ante:
  - Ante 1 ⇒ 0 re-rolls, Ante 2 ⇒ 1 re-roll, etc.

**Legendary Jokers:**
- Found in arcana & spectral packs.

This mod does not search for jokers found using skip vouchers.

## Future Plans

- Search for vouchers / spectral cards / playing cards
- Customisation options (custom re-rolls per ante, adjustable search timeouts, etc.)
